/**
 * GetImage loads an image from the specified file path and optionally resizes it.
 * The method uses an in-memory cache to store processed images for faster later access.
 * 
 * # Parameters:
 *   - filePath: The path to the image file to load
 *   - size: The target size for the longest dimension of the image. If size is 0, the image is returned at its original
 *     dimensions. If size > 0, the image is resized proportionally so that its longest dimension (width or height)
 *     equals the specified size, using Lanczos resampling for high quality.
 * 
 * # Returns:
 *   - []byte: The image data encoded as PNG bytes (lossless)
 *   - error: An error if the image cannot be loaded, processed, or encoded
 * 
 * The method initializes a memory cache on first use with a capacity of 100 MB and a maximum of 100 entries. Cached
 * images have a TTL of 24 hours or until the app is closed.
